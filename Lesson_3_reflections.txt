When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository can be used when one needs to share his/her code with another developer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be adding new changes or fixing a bug and so i dont want it to be updated till I am ready to do so.
