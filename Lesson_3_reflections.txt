Q.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository can be used when one needs to share his/her code with another developer.

Q.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be adding new changes or fixing a bug and so i dont want it to be updated till I am ready to do so.

Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are created by making a copy is from one repository to another in GitHub .This makes sure the original author gets the credit for his code. Clones are making a copy of existing repository in either GitHub to local or local to another location in the computer.
    Branch is created on a single repository.

Q.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Incase you are planning to be offline for sometime then it would be best to save a copy of the last known state of the remote locally so that u can use git diff and git log to get all the changes .

Q.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub i guess we will have to use a shared folder where everyone makes their contributions to a particular project.It would be hard to merge the codes but it would be easier to keep track of everyone who is working on it.
